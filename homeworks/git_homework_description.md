# How to submit your git homework?

Check the [Git User Guide](../docs/how_to_use_git.md) for details on the commands if you need.

1. Create a new branch for yourself with a name containing first the **date** when you create it and then your **course id**. <br>
   (Check `git checkout` command for details on the branch creation.) <br>
    *E.g. 20250314_qwertya__git_homework*

2. Add your **course id** to 'my_config.json' before you run the following script.
3. Run 'git_homework.py' script <br>
   * Either using `run_script.bat` on the root by feeding the script name. After navigating in command line to the root
     of our repo, run:
        > run_script.bat git_homework.py
     
   * OR setting up PyCharm, and run the script with it:
       * Our virtual env needs to be added as Python Interpreter (from the path `venv_quant_course_v39\Scripts\python.exe`) 
       * Then right-click on 'git_homework.py' will offer you to run it as a script (or debug into it if you want)

4. Create a new folder called by your **course id** in 'homeworks', and move in the 3 new files generated by the
'git_homework.py' script there.
5. Commit the 3 new files and your other changes to your branch. <br>
(Check `git add` and `git commit` commands for details on committing.)
6. Create a new subfolder for the rest of your homework in your special folder, and commit it.
7. Push your branch to the remote repository.
(Check `git push` command for details on pushing a new branch.)
